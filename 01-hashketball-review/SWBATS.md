# HASHKETBALL REVIEW

## Day 1 - SE and SF Web 042020

## Welcome to your 1st lecture!

#### SWBATS ( Students will be able to)
- [ ] RSPEC Tests (`--fail-fast`, `--f-f`)
- [ ] Debugging Tools (`binding.pry`, `puts`)
- [ ] Refactoring Code (DRY - Do Not Repeat Yourself - Principles)
- [ ] Advanced Iterators (`find`, `map`, `select`, `reduce`, `max_by`)
- [ ] Comment Code
- [ ] Show how to look up documentation for data types in Ruby
- [ ] Differentiate array methods by their respective return values
- [ ] Define the Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] Employ test-driven development best practices in their labs

#### General TIPS
- There is no one way to solve a problem. Today's goal is to write functional code. Efficiency will be factored in later in the program.
- Make it work (shameless green), make it right, make it fast
- Google is your friend. 
    - 1st Google
    - 2nd Cohort Mate
    - 3rd Instructor
- Errors are good. Let them guide you to the answer.
- Grow comfortable breaking your code.
- Test early. Test often.
- The solutions are there, it's not the best or the correct solution.
- You can code along to lecture, but typically not recommended.
    - Students hit a bug, or typo and try to fix it, and end up losing track of lecture.
    - I recommend just focusing on lectures and asking questions as they come up
- I will still load up SWBATS and lecture starter code if you want to have it for reference.
